WooCommerce POS Language Packs
==============================

This repository contains the language packs for [WooCommerce POS - the Point of Sale Plugin](http://woopos.com.au) for WooCommerce. 
Updates to the language packs will appear automatically through the WordPress admin.

## Updating the translation files ##

There are several ways to update the language files:

### 1. Open an issue ###

If you notice a single typo or word that needs translating you can simply [open an issue](https://github.com/kilbot/WooCommerce-POS-Language-Packs/issues) with your change request.

### 2. Update files using GitHub ###

GitHub has an online editor which can be used to edit the .po files. First, [make a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) of the repository. 
Then, find your locale in the language directory. Next, [edit the .po file](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/) 
(note: each directory contains the POS and admin files for both the free and Pro plugins).
 
Once you have updated the .po file you can then [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to have the changes committed to the main repository.

### 3. Update files using Poedit ###

[Poedit](http://poedit.net/) is a desktop application which provides a graphical interface for editing .po files. 
If you have Poedit installed you can use the **Edit a translation** option to open a .po file.

First, [fork and clone](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)  the WooCommerce POS Language Packs project to your computer.
Navigate to the newly created project directory and open the files using Poedit. Then submit a [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).
