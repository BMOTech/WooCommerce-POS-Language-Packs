WooCommerce POS Language Packs
==============================

This repository contains the language packs for [WooCommerce POS - the Point of Sale Plugin](http://woopos.com.au). 
Updates to the language packs will appear automatically through the WordPress admin.

## Updating the translation files ##

There are several ways to update the language files:

### 1. [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/woocommerce-pos/) ###

Transifex is an online service for translations - similar to GlotPress, but with a much nicer user interface. To get started, simply click the button below.

</p>

### 2. Open an issue ###

If you notice a typo or single word that needs translating you can simply [open an issue](https://github.com/kilbot/WooCommerce-POS-Language-Packs/issues) with your change request.

### 3. Update files using GitHub ###

GitHub has an online editor which can be used to edit the .po files. First, [make a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) of the repository. 
Then, find your locale in the language directory. Next, [edit the .po file](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/) 
(note: each directory contains the POS and admin files for both the free and Pro plugins).
 
Once you have updated the .po file you can [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to have the changes committed to the main repository.

### 4. Update files using Poedit ###

[Poedit](http://poedit.net/) is a desktop application which provides a graphical interface for editing .po files. 
If you have Poedit installed you can use the **Edit a translation** option to edit .po files.

First, [fork and clone](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)  the WooCommerce POS Language Packs project to your computer.
Navigate to the newly created project directory and open your locale .po files using Poedit. 

Once you have updated the .po file you can [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to have the changes committed to the main repository.
